# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Design provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH).
Credits to Daniel Lawrence for [this article](https://daniel.lawrence.lu/programming/rps/) which helped me a lot with writing an algorithm for the computer's decision making.

It's all vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. 

The current algorithm uses scores for each of the moves that get updated each round based on the human player last picked move.
The moves that beat the player's last move go up in score while the ones that lose to it go down in score.
It's a very easy to counter algorithm but it's still better than just picking a movie at random, which is what i was going for.

I am hoping to get back to this project at one point in order to update it with a more complex and better performing algorithm.
